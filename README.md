# Server Side Routing Module Project

## Introduction

Use `Node.js` and `Express` to build an API that performs _CRUD_ operations on `blog posts`.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup

- import this repository into your account
- clone **your copy** of this repository.
- **CD into the folder** where you cloned the repository.
- Type `npm install` to download all dependencies.
- To start the server, type `npm run server` from the root folder (where the _package.json_ file is). The server is configured to restart automatically as you make changes.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

- Add the code necessary to implement the endpoints listed below.
- Separate the endpoints that begin with `/api/posts` into a separate `Express Router`.

#### Endpoints

Configure the API to handle to the following routes:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /api/posts              | Creates a post using the information sent inside the `request body`.                                                                                                        |
| POST   | /api/posts/:id/comments | Creates a comment for the post with the specified id using information sent inside of the `request body`.                                                                   |
| GET    | /api/posts              | Returns an array of all the post objects contained in the database.                                                                                                         |
| GET    | /api/posts/:id          | Returns the post object with the specified id.                                                                                                                              |
| GET    | /api/posts/:id/comments | Returns an array of all the comment objects associated with the post with the specified id.                                                                                 |
| DELETE | /api/posts/:id          | Removes the post with the specified id and returns the **deleted post object**. You may need to make additional calls to the database in order to satisfy this requirement. |
| PUT    | /api/posts/:id          | Updates the post with the specified `id` using data from the `request body`. Returns the modified document, **NOT the original**.                                           |

### Database Persistence Helpers

The `data` folder contains a database populated with test `posts`.

Database access will be done using the `db.js` file included inside the `data` folder.

The `db.js` publishes the following methods.

- `find()`: calling find returns a promise that resolves to an array of all the `posts` contained in the database.
- `findById()`: this method expects an `id` as it's only parameter and returns a promise that resolves to the post corresponding to the `id` provided or an empty array if no post with that `id` is found.
- `insert()`: calling insert passing it a `post` object will add it to the database and return a promise that resolves to an object with the `id` of the inserted post. The object looks like this: `{ id: 123 }`.
- `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the post to update and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. It returns a promise that resolves to the count of updated records. If the count is 1 it means the record was updated correctly.
- `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as its first parameter and upon successfully deleting the post from the database it returns a promise that resolves to the number of records deleted.
- `findPostComments()`: the findPostComments accepts a `postId` as its first parameter and returns a promise that resolves to an array of all comments on the post associated with the post id.
- `findCommentById()`: accepts an `id` and returns a promise that resolves to the comment associated with that id.
- `insertComment()`: calling insertComment while passing it a `comment` object will add it to the database and return a promise that resolves to an object with the `id` of the inserted comment. The object looks like this: `{ id: 123 }`. This method will throw an error if the `post_id` field in the `comment` object does not match a valid post id in the database.

Now that we have a way to add, update, remove and retrieve data from the provided database, it is time to work on the API.

### Blog Post Schema

A Blog Post in the database has the following structure:

```js
{
  title: "The post title", // String, required
  contents: "The post contents", // String, required
  created_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
  updated_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
}
```

### Comment Schema

A Comment in the database has the following structure:

```js
{
  text: "The text of the comment", // String, required
  post_id: "The id of the associated post", // Integer, required, must match the id of a post entry in the database
  created_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
  updated_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
}
```

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

To work on the stretch problems you'll need to enable the `cors` middleware. Follow these steps:

- add the `cors` npm module: `npm i cors`.
- add `server.use(cors())` after `server.use(express.json())`.

Create a new React application and connect it to your server:

- Use `create-react-app` to create an application inside the root folder, name it `client`.
- From the React application connect to the `/api/posts` endpoint in the API and show the list of posts.
- Style the list of posts however you see fit.
